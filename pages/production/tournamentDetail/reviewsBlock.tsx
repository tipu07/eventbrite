						<p>It was a real pleasure working with Steve. We weren't sure whether we would sell our house and get the best price in a slow market. We met with Steve and explained our reservations and from the get-go, he was extremely patient and eased our decision-making process. We had a professional photographer at our house and within less than a week, we had offers way over our asking price.</p>
